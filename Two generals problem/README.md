# Task: 2 generals problem (you will find it on google)

## Approach:
First general sends about 20 messengers with a message which has a unique ID unkown to the second general,

Second general may receive all 20 or less than 20 messages, but all will have the same ID, hence, he can assure that he is getting the same message multiple times.

The second general now confirms it by sending 20 messengers with a confirmation message again, with a unique ID, and the first general receives it.

Ofcourse this will happen for infinite number of times.
